## My collection of TIC-80 roms
- test1: At the moment just an initial "what can I do with this, and how does this function work" attempt at a platformer.
- music: exported the music from test1 separately.
- gameoflife: conway's game of life, starts paused, set nodes to on/off  with <Z on kb, A on controller> and press <X on kb, B on controller> to unpause
- cel_automata: an altered conway's game of life, different ruleset to make a kind of randompath to use/copy for map generation in shecome later
- shecome: he is coming remake for tic80, idk how far I can get with this, but so far I have a system for map, an inventory system, stat system and player movement/cursor movement with tooltips in menu,
  - to do: loot, enemies, combat, procedural gen of map(if possible), step timer, bosses, shops etc



Might toy around with it some more later.
